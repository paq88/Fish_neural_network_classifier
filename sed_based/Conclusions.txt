From the analysis of sediment samples—focusing on bacterial families, KEGG pathways, and KEGG orthology—using Feed Forward Neural Networks (NNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and XGBoost, it appears that differences are primarily observable between the two timepoints at which samples were collected. No clear distinctions could be detected or classified between the experimental setups. While oversampling improved validation performance in most cases, this improvement likely stemmed from the oversampled data being too similar to the original samples. As a result, test dataset performance remained poor across all approaches that employed oversampling to address class imbalance or to artificially increase sample size, which posed a significant challenge for this analysis.
